# About The Project

A technology agnostic cli for common semantic versioning operations.

Built with [Deno](https://deno.land/) ðŸ¦•

# Installation

Binaries can be found in the
[Releases](https://github.com/Optum/semver-cli/releases) section. Get the
[latest](https://github.com/Optum/semver-cli/releases/latest) or install from a
supported package manager below.

Installing from binaries or package manager does _not_ require the Deno runtime
to also be installed.

## Homebrew

```sh
brew install optum/tap/semver
```

via [optum](https://github.com/Optum/homebrew-tap)

## From Source

Installation from source will require
[Deno](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) to be installed.

#### module

```sh
deno install --allow-run --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write https://deno.land/x/semver-cli@0.2.1/main.ts -n semver
```

### git

```sh
git clone https://github.com/optum/semver-cli.git
cd semver-cli
deno task install
```

# Usage

```
semver <command>

Commands:
  semver get            Get the version
  semver set <current>  Set the version
  semver inc            Increment the version
  semver parse [value]  Parse the version

Options:
  --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]
  --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]
```

### About

The `get`, `set` and `inc` commands operate against your working directory. They
all operate against a `VERSION` file found in the root folder of your project.

If the `VERSION` file is not found the default version is `0.1.0`. The `inc`
command will create the `VERSION` file if it doesn't already exist.

The `parse` command can accept an optional version string as input, if one is
not provided it will read from the `VERSION` file, if that is not found the
version will be `0.1.0`.

#### examples

```sh
# No VERSION file
semver get # 0.1.0
```

```sh
# Sets the VERSION file to 1.2.3 specifically
semver set 1.2.3  # 1.2.3
```

```sh
# Gets the version and increments it, but does not update the VERSION file
semver get minor # 1.3.0
semver get # 1.2.3
```

```sh
# parses a version string
semver parse 1.0.0 # {"major":1,"minor":1,"patch":0,"prerelease":[],"build":[]}
```

### Incrementing

When calling the command `inc` the `VERSION` file will be updated based on the
sub command specified, `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `none`. Additional metadata
may be added to the version using the `--pre` and `--build` parameters. If the
`--name` parameter is specified then that will be used instead of the default
`pre`. If the same prerelease name is used multiple times the prerelease number
will be incremented and it defaults to `0` if set initially or changed to a new
name. If the argument `--value` is set then the prerelease number will be
specifically set to the value provided.

`none` can be used to synchronize new or out of sync files with post hooks, and
also it can be used in conjunction with `--pre` and `--build` without
incrementing the main version numbers.

#### examples

```sh
semver set 1.2.3
semver inc none  # 1.2.3
semver inc patch # 1.2.4
semver inc minor # 1.3.0
semver inc major # 2.0.0
```

```sh
semver set 1.2.3-pre.0
semver inc --pre              # 1.2.3-pre.1
semver inc --pre --value 10   # 1.2.3-pre.10
semver inc --pre --name alpha # 1.2.3-alpha.0
semver inc --build 1          # 1.2.3-alpha.1+1
semver inc --pre \
  --name alpha \
  --value 11 \
  --build abc123              # 1.2.3-alpha.11+abc123
```

### Increment Post Hooks

In addition to updating the `VERSION` file, semver can optionally update source
code files in your project. To configure the version command you can provide a
configuration file at `.github/version.yml`.

There are a number of supported post hook kinds and a number of supported known
project kinds which make updating source code files easy.

#### post hook kind

| kind      | description                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `replace` | replaced the previous version string with the next version string in a file |
| `patch`   | supports auto-updating a set of well known file types (e.g. package.json)   |
| `regexp`  | replaces matching string using a regexp                                     |

#### patch file kinds

| file kind      | description                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.csproj`      | Updates the `<PropertyGroup><Version>0.1.0</Version></PropertyGroup>` element  |
| `package.json` | Updates the `"version": "0.1.0"` of the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` |
| `Chart.yaml`   | Updates the `version: 0.1.0` of the chart file                                 |
| `pom.xml`      | Updates the `<project><version>0.1.0</version></project>` element              |

> If you would like another well known file type supported please file an issue
> or contribute a pull request. The `replace` or `regexp` post hook kinds are
> flexible in the meantime.

#### example

```yml
on:
  post:
    # Updates both package.json and package-lock.json
    - kind: patch
      file: package.json
      
    # Uses non-matching groups to isolate the version to replace.
    - kind: regexp
      file: src/info.js
      pattern: '^(?<=export const version = ").*(?=";)$'
```
